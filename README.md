# Logoed!

Heya, so this is Gareth, Sunday, March 29th, 2020, and I just pulled in a bunch of stuff from the old React Native project, and haven't yet pulled in anything from the old Progressive Web App project, so if I die, don't judge me solely based on this please :)

## Update!

Gareth here, Friday, April 9th, and it sorta works! It's not super-polished, and there's something buggy about ... well about a lot of it, but specifically viewshot doesn't always get the logo _and_ the snapshot, but it worked well enough for me to record a demo of the new design/flow/whatever! Yea! If I die, you can judge me on this one (this one divided by a week and a half and neighbors who won't let me sleep, lol!) Best wishes! ~g
